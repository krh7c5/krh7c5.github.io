<h3> About Me </h3>
    
<!-- Hey Curtis!  I like that you shared a little about your self; family, reading, work, etc. You kept it short and sweet, leaving room for more later on. In regards to breaking up your paragraph... I think that it should stay as is.  Breaking it up may take away from the flow and readability. The bold and emphasized words do work. You reminded me about italics and I edited mine, too.  So, I owe you on that one!  -->
    
<p> My name is Curtis Thomas. I’m a middle school librarian in Springfield, MO. My wife teaches 3rd grade. We have two sons, a three year old and a nine month old. In my free time I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy (or just about anything else I can get my hands on). I also like playing video games and spending time with my family. <br> I was a high school English teacher before becoming a school librarian. I taught anything from core English courses to film and broadcast to running the yearbook. I also spent time as a college teacher while earning my Master’s degree in English. Now I get to combine my passion for reading with my love of technology, working with teachers and students to <strong>learn, research, and create</strong>. One of my <em>favorite</em> parts of my job is helping a reluctant reader find a book they <em>love</em>. I also love trying new tech tools and sharing them with teachers. </p>
