Hello world!  My name is Ken, and I am excited about developing web design skills!  I have zero experience in web development and design.  I look forward to having a new understanding.  Likewise, I have one main expectation from this course.  I want to have experiences that I can apply to my profession as an educator and principal.  I look forward to applying my web development skills in two ways.  Two ways includes constructing my own sites and sharing this with my peers. My favorite hobby is to be active outside.  I do not currently have free time, and I am very happy with that!  I have a wife, two young children, work, and I am in graduate school! Furthermore, I spend every minute I can with my family. When I graduate in August, I look forward to getting back some free time to work on new projects around the house.
