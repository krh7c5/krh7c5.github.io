    <h3><strong>A little about me...</strong></h3>
   
Hello world!  My name is Ken, and I am excited about developing web design skills!  I have zero experience in web development and design.  I look forward to having a new understanding.  
Likewise, I have one main expectation from this course.  I want to have experiences that I can apply to my profession as an educator and principal.  I look forward to applying my web development skills in two ways.  Two ways includes <strong>constructing my own sites</strong> and <strong>sharing</strong> this with my <em>peers</em>. My favorite hobby is to be active outside.  I do not currently have free time, and I am very happy with that!  I have a wife, two young children, work, and I am in graduate school! Furthermore, I spend every minute I can with my family. When I graduate in August, I look forward to getting back some free time to work on new projects around the house.
